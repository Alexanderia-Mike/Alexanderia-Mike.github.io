                    It is hard to find a complex testcase that runs in reasonable time (round 10s) and is suitable for
                    parallelizing. We've tried generating test cases by drawing complex maps. However, the maps we can
                    draw are still too naive and can mostly be colored in at most 2 colors. In this case, even using
                    brute force, it takes less than a second to color a map with 10000 nodes.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-light">
                    Therefore, we decide to write code to randomly generate nodes and edges. We need to make sure the
                    edges cannot cross each other so that they can be transformed to maps. To generate a complex test
                    case, we also need to ensure there is a balanced usage of 4 colors so that brute force needs to
                    traverse more recursions, thus requiring more time. However, we also need to control the number of
                    nodes so that the total time is controllable as the number of recursions grows exponentially with
                    the number of nodes.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-light">
                    After many trials, we find the suitable number of nodes is between 40 - 100. Since we cannot know
                    the total runtime beforehand, we can only make random trials by tuning the configurations (node
                    number, edge number). To expedite it, we write a bash to automatically generate test cases, run them
                    and save those whose runtime is around 10 seconds.

                    At first, we plan to build the front end based on the exsiting github repo as given in the proposal.
                    That repo uses processing.js to write both the front end and the algorithm parts. However, we need
                    to separate them as we need to parallelize the algorithm part on GHC or PSC. To realize it, we need
                    to have network transfer or file I/O so that the front end and the back end can communicate each
                    other. Unfortunately, we find that processing.js can support neither of them. We have no choice but
                    to rewrite the front end part using p5.js and implement the algorithm part using C++.

                    We plan to bring a fully interactive web application to the poster session, and encourage visitors
                    to draw their own maps for our program to solve. We may allow the user to specify whether or not
                    they want to enable parallelization on backend server. Considering the fact that the advantage of
                    parallel program will not be obvious unless the map becomes really large and complicated, we will
                    also offer some complicated map options that we prepared in advance, and the users can simply click
                    those options on the screen for a quick demo of how parallel program can accelerate the solving

                    considerations we took into account throughout our way to the final version of the program.

                            We decide not to parallelize the sorting phase in heuristic algorithm. The reason is that
                            even for the map with more than 10000 nodes, the runtime of heuristic algorithm is less than
                            1 second. Besides, it's unrealistic to have a map with 10000 nodes. Therefore, we don't find
                            much space in the heuristic algorithm for parallelization.

                            We will focus on the backtracking algorithm. When the map is complex enough, the runtime of
                            backtracking algorithm grows exponentially with the number of nodes. In this case,
                            parallelization can greatly help speed up the whole process. Since the recursions are
                            independent of each other, we won't meet many obstacles in implementing parallelization. We
                            still need to explore more to find the reasonable speedup. We will try different scheduling
                            algorithms and memory allocation to find the optimal one. At this moment, we hope to achieve
                            3x speedup.

                            relationship between two countries). We now decided to delegate this task to backend server

                    For the backtracking algorithm, in each recursion, we traverse four colors in a loop to find a
