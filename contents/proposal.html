                <p class="fw-light"> The four-color problem derives from
                    four-color theorem, which states that any map is
                    colorable with 4 different colors, such that after
                    coloring, any two adjacent countries have different
                    colors. There is a heuristic algorithm for it called
                    welsh-powell algorithm. However, it does not guarantee
                    to succeed. When it fails, we need to use backtracking
                    to do a brute-force search. </p>
                <p class="fw-light"> There is space for acceleration in both

                    heuristic algorithm, it constructs a graph and then
                    sorts the vertices based on their valence, which is
                    time-consuming when the graph is large. We can partition
                    the graph into grids, sort vertices in each sub-graph in
                    parallel, then merge them to a global sorted list. For
                    the backtracking algorithm, it follows a recursive
                    pattern and is compute-intensive. We plan to use
                    fork-join tools such as openMP for realizing
                    parallelsim. </p>

                    <p class="fw-light"> The heuristic algorithm is
                        intrinsically difficult
                        to parallelize due to high dependencies. It consists
                        of two phases, sorting and coloring. The second
                        phase is a traversal over all nodes where the
                        decision in each iteration depends on the result in
                        all previous iterations. Such sequential
                        dependencies prevents itself from being
                        parallelized. The first sorting phase has less
                        strict dependencies among its steps, thus giving
                        more opportunities to parallelize (e.g. merge sort
                        algorithm), but an efficient algorithm that
                        minimizes overhead and maximizes memory locality is
                        still non-intuitive to design. </p>

                        execution, therefore being suitable for fork-join
                        parallelization patterns, there is one more
                        complexity -- the program does not need to wait all
                        the tasks to be completed, instead it may stop as
                        soon as one thread finds a valid solution. Therefore
                        we need to design a way that could stop all other
                        running/waiting tasks once a solution is found,
                        which is not intuitive to implement. </p>

                For the heuristic algorithm, we aim to speedup the sorting part
                by 2x considering the possibility of false sharing, load imbalance
                and communication overhead. For the backtracking algorithm, we aim
                to speedup by 3x because the tasks are independent, thus creating
                more space for parallelism. However, it is restricted by the
                scheduling overhead. We plan to exploit different scheduling
                algorithms in openMP, including static, dynamic and guided. We
                try to find the best one based on the the tradeoff between
                workload balance and synchronization overhead.

                We hope to achieve higher speedup (3x for heuristic algorithm

                Besides, we hope to seek for space in accelerating the coloring
                phase of the heuristic algorithm. Since the iterations in this
                phase are dependent are each other, this poses a great challenge for us.
