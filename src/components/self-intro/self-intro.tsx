                    Hi, I'm Chenfei Lou. You can also call me Mike. <br/>
                    I obtained my becholar's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai jiao Tong 
                    University, China. 
                    I'm currently a Carnegie Mellon University Master Student majoring in Electrical Engineering, 
                    and focusing on software system design and development. I'm determined to become a full-stack
                    software development engineer, and my dream is to establish my own software company someday in 
                    the future (really an ambitious dream though XD). <br/>
                    I have many hobbies, including badminton, fitness, magic cube, swimming and, above all, travelling! 
                    I've travelled to many places. The only continent that I've not put my footprint on is the Antarctica. 
                    I love travelling because it helps me to embrace different cultures and traditions. Sometimes it's 
                    so astonishing and fascinating to see that lives are so radically different in different places, but 
                    after digging in to explore the historical and cultural reasons behind, those specific life styles 
                    that look weird first suddenly become so logical and wise. That's why I believe ravelling is one of 
                    the most intelligent teacher. <br/>
